`SiegeNebula` is a project that my teammate and I worked on during fall 2016 semester in Stony Brook University. In this realtime strategy game, player plays as a space commander trying to allocate the troops and take over all the planets.


We built this game using Unity3D. All the 3D models were made in Blender. The game is playable through Android, Windows and WebGL. You can view the source code on [Github](https://github.com/yiochen/SiegeNebula).
