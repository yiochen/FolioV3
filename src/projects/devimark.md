Besides coding, drawing is also one of my hobbies. I go to [deviantArt.com](http://www.deviantart.com/) for inspiration and reference. Once in a while, I will find some art works that I like a lot and I wish I could book mark them.

That's why I made deviMark. I used this app to search / browse artworks on [deviantArt]. I can bookmark art work by adding them to collection. For each image, I can open up full screen view to carefully examine the detail.

This app was created using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/). An opinionated hybrid app framework that let you build Android / IOS apps using Angular. I experimented with this framework by building this app, and it turned out to be surprisingly easy. For more information about Ionic, I highly recommend you to check out it's [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/).
