        <p>SiegeNebula is a project that my teammate and I worked on during fall 2016 semester in Stony Brook University. In this realtime strategy game, player plays as a space commander trying to allocate the troops and take over all the planets.</p>
        <p>We built this game using Unity3D. All the 3D models were made in Blender. The game is playable through Android, Windows and WebGL. You can view the source code on <a href="https://github.com/yiochen/SiegeNebula" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
