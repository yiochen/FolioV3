            <p>Solar is a sound visualizer resembling our solar system. It starts out with a single sun in the center. Upon receiving audio input through microphone, it will spawn new planets that rotate around it. Planets can also spawn new planets, but they will eventually die when they spawn too many planets.</p>

            <p>This project is made in Flash. Yes, the good old Flash. Flash was what led me into the world of Computer Science. I still remember back in the day I felt proud of myself knowing Flash and called myself “Flasher”. I didn’t know that it has another <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/flasher">meaning</a>. Now HTML5 killed Flash. To be honest, even till now, I still feel pity about Flash. The scripting language for Flash, ActionScript was the first object-oriented language I learned. It is a very elegant language. I started by adding some code to the timeline. Eventually, I just fired up Flash Builder to start writing code. I still remember that I struggled with some Object Oriented Concept, but I feel lucky that I chose it as my first OOP language.</p>
            <p>I made this project in my freshman year in college. Around 2014. Flash was still very popular with the new “Stage3D” technology that rendered content directly to GPU. I tried to use that for this a class project and “Wow” the whole class. Below is a short video of it.</p>
