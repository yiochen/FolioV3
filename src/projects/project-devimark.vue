            <p>Besides coding, drawing is also one of my hobbies. I go to
                <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantArt.com</a> for inspiration and reference. Once in a while, I will find some art works that I like a lot and I wish I could book mark them.</p>
            <p>That’s why I made deviMark. I used this app to search / browse artworks on [deviantArt]. I can bookmark art work by adding them to collection. For each image, I can open up full screen view to carefully examine the detail.</p>
            <p>This app was created using
                <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>. An opinionated hybrid app framework that let you build Android / IOS apps using Angular. I experimented with this framework by building this app, and it turned out to be surprisingly easy. For more information about Ionic, I highly recommend you to check out it’s
                <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/">documentation</a>.</p>
            <p>You can download a debug version of this app from
                <a href="https://github.com/yiochen/deviMark/releases/download/debug/android-debug.apk">here</a>
